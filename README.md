# Python for Geosciences: Summer School Exercises

This repository contains practical exercises and data processing workflows developed for the Python Summer School (2018). The focus is on handling geospatial datasets, rainfall analysis, and environmental modeling.

## Key Exercises and Workflows

### 1. Rainfall Analysis and Interpolation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Generation of rainfall histograms and descriptive statistics.
- **Interpolation**: Implementation of spatial interpolation techniques to estimate rainfall distributions across a domain.

### 2. Geospatial Data Integration
- **Land Cover Analysis**: Processing of **Corine Land Cover (2006)** datasets to classify land use patterns.
- **Digital Elevation Models (DEM)**: Integrating topographic data with meteorological observations.
- **Data Fusion**: Combining location, height, and land cover attributes for complex site characterization.

## Data Formats
The exercises demonstrate how to handle various data formats:
- `.txt`: Tabular meteorological and elevation data.
- `.pdf`: Documentation of land use classifications.
- `.ipynb`: Interactive analysis notebooks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- SciPy / Geopandas (depending on specific exercise requirements)
